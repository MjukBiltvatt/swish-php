Some rework to package to more easier load .pem-certificates instead of the .p12-variant.

This is a breaking update, however â€“ migrating from v1.0 should take five minutes or less in most cases. Please [review the upgrade guide](https://github.com/olssonm/swish-php/blob/main/UPGRADE.md) for changes.

Support for PHP 7.4 and 8.0 has been dropped.
